# TM Basic Themer

The Tribute Media Basic Themer is created to automate the basic theming task of our workflow, wherein a developer copies the CSS for a site's theme and pastes it into the site's CSS files. This tedious process is now automated, with all css for relevant elements being extracted into a single CSS file that can be uploaded to the site, or copied from and pasted manually where needed.

## Installation

As of this time, only 64-bit OS X is supported.

Download the zipped OS X folder, and place where desired. Make sure the app has read and write permissions to its directory. 

## Usage

Obtain the XD file needed and place within the resources directory. Then, simply run `./tm-basic-themer` in the command line, and follow the prompts to run the program and get your CSS, which will be written to a filename of your choice within the output directory.
